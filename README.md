# SmashWiiUSinglesOverlayStep3
Step 3 of a project to create a dynamically editable overlay for Super Smash Bros. Wii U Singles usable for any tournament streamers using HTML, CSS and C#.

Changes from Step 2:
- The manager solution/application has been added to the project, meaning you don't have to manually edit css files!
- Player Ports and Player Backgrounds are now seperated.

Anyone is allowed to clone this repository and create their own overlay manager if they feel it lacks some functionality that they need for their own tournament streams. I will not accept any pull requests unless it fixes an important bug.

I kept the code as simple and seperated in different functions as possible, to make it easier to understand for beginners in programming, anyone is allowed to clone this repository and refactor the code if they feel the code is too redundant. I will not accept any pull requests unless it fixes an important bug.

- Visual Studio 2017 (or higher) Community (or Professional/Enterprise).

- You can doublecheck whether the application works now by checking if all of the following files exist in "\SmashWiiUOverlayManager\SmashWiiUOverlayManager\bin\{Debug/Release}\Files\css":
- player1Character.css.
- player1NameText.css.
- player1Port.css.
- player1Score.css.
- player2Character.css.
- player2NameText.css.
- player2Port.css.
- player2Score.css.

You are now ready to stream with the overlay.

As the streamed set(s) progress, you can update the overlay by filling in the inputs in the overlay manager.

At this step, the overlay doesn't dynamically update whenever the css is altered, you have to move back and forward between the scene with the overlay and another scene to show an updated overlay.
